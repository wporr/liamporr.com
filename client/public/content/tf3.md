# True Freedom Pt. 3: Fear and Loathing in Joshua Tree

This is a continuation from [part 2](tf2) of my road trip story, but feel free to start here

### Day 4

Some days you're going to wake up tired, sluggish, hungover, sleep deprived, and all other forms of shitty. Now, you have two options to choose from: the first option is to sacrifice that day to the sun god and lay around like a vegetable; the second option is to refuse submission and push forward with undying determination.

I've found that only a certain kind of person chooses the latter option. In fact, it's more of a personality trait than a decision. Most people either have a second-option friend or they are the second-option friend. The second-option friend is what we call the “Perpetual Motion (Wo)Man”. This person plays a very special role in friend groups. This is the person who is in constant motion, the one who rallies the troops no matter how exhausted either they or the other group members may be. These people tend to have erratic personalities who's blatant disregard for the laws of physics borders on psychosis. I have fallen into both camps at one time or another. But, on this day I was the

_Perpetual Motion Man._

At 7AM I woke up sideways on a couch with someone's feet in my face. I was confused as to how both I and the feet ended up there, but without skipping a beat I drove over to C’s place and we left for Joshua Tree. I have spent remarkably little time in SoCal considering the four years I've lived in California, so this particular destination was long overdue.

Going into Joshua Tree I wasn't expecting much: mostly just desert and some funny looking trees. But, once we crossed the threshold into the park I realized I was so, so wrong.

I threw Solace by Rufus Du Sol on the stereo, and it felt like we were at the outer reaches of a foreign planet.

Shielded by the punishing 40mph winds, we were on the desert highroads looking for some enlightenment. The rock formations and trees are a sight to behold and we enjoyed their company while searching fruitlessly for an open camp spot.

Every once and a while a person needs to head to the desert. One must retreat from society to a place of solitude so that they may collect their thoughts, discover new insights, and return to civilization armed with their new knowledge.

I had, by some bizarre coincidence, received some very interesting personal news right before we entered the park. The details aren’t important, but the news was part of a story that dates back two years ago and was an important part of my college experience. In other words I was, once again, faced with two options: remain steadfast on my journey or pull back. I stuck to my guns and kept forward with even more determination.

My friends and I gave up on trying to find a regular camping spot, and opted for the backpacking camps. This meant we would hike about a mile and find a spot to camp in the open desert. We climbed up Mt. Ryan and scouted out a large hill for our camp that could shield us from the wind and give us a good view of the sunset.

After reaching our spot, we ate our dinner and headed up to view the sunset. What proceeded was one of the most beautiful, scary, and intense experiences of my life. The sunset itself was covered by clouds, but this ended up being even better than the sunset itself. With a panoramic view of the park, we watched the clouds roll over the mountains and onto us.

We were, literally and figuratively, in the clouds.

We played music and danced on rocks while the stars came out. Atop that rock it felt like we were on a seat to view the heavens with. Sometimes to look in you have to look up, and there I found a lot of the answers I was looking for, and some I wasn’t. I don’t think I will ever forget this experience.

In moments like these I’m just so awestruck by what’s around me. It makes me want to extract every drop of life while I have the chance, and it makes it hard to understand why I would waste my time doing anything else.

And yet, as I write this I am back in my normal routine, dealing with the day-to-day frustrations and struggling to remember what this moment was like. We always have to go back to our responsibilities, there's no escaping that. But, having experiences like this and remembering them can help inspire us. It can give us that little push we need to go out and remember why life's worth living.

### Day 5

That morning we woke to the sound of tapping on our tent. I just thought it was bushes rubbing against our tent and went back to sleep. I didn't put on the rain fly because, ya know, it's the desert. Plus, we wanted to see the stars. Well when I woke up soaking wet I realized that was a mistake, because that tapping was in fact sleet.

Yes, that's right. Sleet in the desert in April. That’s the last time I leave my rain fly off.

After quickly breaking down our cold and wet gear, we got breakfast outside the park and happened to run into a friend of ours. Then, we said our short goodbyes and parted ways. They were headed back to LA and Berkeley, and I was off to San Diego with a detour around the Salton Sea. Specifically, Slab City.

I’ve heard enough about this place that I had to stop by. Slab City is a squatter camp/anarchist art collective outside of Niland CA. Niland is about as poor as California gets. The median Per-Capita income is $27,500 according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niland,_California), and has a population of about 500, half of what it was 10 years ago before a large fire drove out most of the population. About a mile outside of this deserted town is one of the most interesting places I've ever visited.

When you enter Slab City you're first greeted by salvation mountain, it’s impossible to miss and it’s as far as most people dare to venture.

I knew that the town went a lot deeper than this, so I kept exploring. I passed many places that were essentially shacks and had written in big, bold letters on the side “OCCUPIED”. After passing the Church of Enlightenment, some campgrounds, and a hostel, I ended up at my final destination—the community library.

This was unlike anything I’ve ever seen. I’ve lived in some of the Berkeley Co-Ops, which had a similar feel, but this was way off the deep end.

It felt like I walked into the scene of a Mad Max movie. The building wasn’t more than a tin roof, no walls. It was enough to keep the sun from damaging the books while letting in a much needed breeze. In addition to books there were shrunken heads, zines, hula hoops, bunker house music, doll heads, antlers, art murals, and my favorite—a bar, with $2 Cuervo shots.

To add onto the mountain of coincidences that have already occurred on this trip, I ended up running into some other folks at the library. They were from Berkeley and, big surprise, they lived in the Co-Op System. We even had mutual friends (a lot, in fact). 562.2 miles away from Berkeley at the outer edge of civilization and I’m still running into people close to my inner circle. It’s such a small world.

We had a drink together and one of them showed me some of their artwork they made the day before (turns out, they were also in Joshua Tree seeking enlightenment).

It’s strange how the world forces you to reflect on your past. Running into these people reminded me of a different stage of my college experience, back when I was living in the Co-Op system and still trying to find my "group". I was so preoccupied at the time that I didn't realize how unique that experience was. Few people where I grew up will ever get to experience something like that.

A quote from [Ava's blog](https://ava.substack.com/p/permitting-intensity-week-2-check?r=75opn&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy)

> It seems to me that the Murakami quote about how “If you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking” also applies to lived experience: there are certain forms of knowledge that will be denied to you if you stay within the bounds.

There are few places in the world where you will find people more loving and open than in the Berkeley Co-Op system. It’s hippie culture to the max, but I really enjoyed it. Cleaning the house together, shared meals, bare feet, hanging out on the patio, drinking together, community. What I loved about it was the lack of expectations. You could be whoever you wanted to be and they would accept you with open arms, as long as that didn't include being an asshole.

I tried buying two books from the library. Both were technical books from the 70’s, one on renewable energy in the home (less on electricity and more on natural heat sources), and the other on plumbing. When I asked for the price, I was told that the library is "donation based".

Seeing my confusion, the owner responded with “We’re anarchists, we don’t support Capitalism. Donate what you think is fair. Just don’t piss me off or I’ll kick you the fuck out”. I donated a few dollars and I remembered not to take kindness for granted.

A few days later, I was in back in Berkeley. Just like that, I was back in normal civilization.
