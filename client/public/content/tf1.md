# True Freedom Pt. 1: Learning to Trust Myself Again

About a month ago I went on a solo trip around Southern California. I was itching to get out and go on a journey, and I liked the idea of doing it on my own terms. More importantly however, this is the final step in my struggle to regain faith in my independence.

There’s a lot of context around this. I’ve always been an independent person, but sometimes that bordered on seclusion. At one point, I spent a few summers on my own in the San Jose/Sunnyvale area for internships. That was my first experience living out on my own. I don’t count college living. In college you’re surrounded by other students, that's student-world. Working in South Bay was my first taste of the real-world.

This was one of the loneliest experiences of my life. The area was unfamiliar, I didn’t know anyone, I made few friends, and I never felt comforable. Back then I had a very different attitude towards people, friendships, and life in general. That experience was my 18 year old high school worldview facing the real world. It crushed my excitement for life after college. Instead of being excited to live on my own terms, I was scared. If this is what post-college life is like then I want no part of it.

When Covid hit, I decided it was time to start from scratch. I built an entirely different attitude towards [friends](https://liamporr.com/friendship) and work. Now, I’ve graduated college and my entry into the real-world is getting closer every day. Time to put my new attitude to the test.

That’s what this trip was about. A sneak peek, a story of redemption.

Here’s how it went:

### Day 1
I dropped off my girlfriend and her friends at the airport. They were going to party in Cabo, and I was going on my own journey. We parted ways and I was off to Pacifica, on the western side of the San Francisco Peninsula. I stopped at a gas station to fill up, grab some coffee, and buy some cheap sunglasses because I knew I was going to loose them (took me three days).

At this point I am bubbling with excitement. I’m already setting myself up for success: having the right attitude is 95% of the work, and right now I have a damn good one. The tough part is keeping it going.
The drive down PCH from Pacifica to Santa Cruz was stunning. There was a superbloom of yellow buttercup flowers, and it was impossible to not trespass on some property and take photos.

I had lunch in Santa Cruz at a place called Harbor Cafe, then drove on to Monterey. In _Travels with Charlie_, John Steinbeck was disappointed by the new cookie-cutter housing developments around his former stomping grounds. I hesitate to say that Steinbeck was wrong, but I thought Monterey still had one of the most unique landscapes I’ve seen on the west coast. I especially recommend going on 17 mile drive in Pebble Beach. The rocks, Cypress trees, and supercars are a sight to see.

By this point, I hit my first roadblock: there was a huge mudslide that took away a big chunk of PCH in the middle of Big Sur. Our options: camp in Big Sur that night and double back the next day, sacrificing precious hours and a free camping spot, or drive to SLO. I opted for the latter.

During the ride down I called up some old friends, listened to Matthew McConaughey’s book _Greenlights_ (I liked it so much that I read it again a week later), and enjoyed views of the central valley.

After finding out that the free campground I heard about was closed and attempting to pick the padlock on the gate unsuccessfully, I traveled down to Morro Bay Strand Campground on the recommendation from some people I met from Santa Barbara. Luckily there was last-minute availability and I had a spot to sleep.

I spent most of that day thinking about what it was like last time I was in Santa Cruz during the summer after my freshman year, the first summer I lived out on my own. It gave me flashbacks to my mental state during that time: uncomfortable, depressed, and beginning to form my fear of growing up.

In the past, I would sometimes feel ashamed for going places alone, because it was not my choice to be alone. Due to lack of effort on my part and subsequent lack of interest on the part of others, I had few close friends.

This time was different. This time I was alone, but I had chosen to do so. This distinction is important, and very empowering. I’m traveling around confidently, because I have many close friends who would have loved to spend this time with me. That is, if we were on that sort of trip. But, we are not on that sort of trip, we are on this sort of trip, and it’s important that I do it alone.

This ability, to make new friends and make my own fun, is completely liberating. Suddenly, going to new places doesn’t seem so scary. Venturing into the unknown still isn’t easy: it takes just about all my attention to adjust to a new environment and make some fun of it. But, I can now rest assured in my ability to do so.

Now that I remember these struggles I realize how important they were for my growth. It helped me  understand myself, and the more you’re able to understand yourself, the more confident you become.

Confidence. It’s not something you can pull out of thin air, that’s just ego. Confidence comes when you have a strong sense of self. Confidence is knowing who you are so well that nobody can talk you out of it. You have more assurance about what, how, and why you should be doing what you're doing. When you lack confidence, you become timid, confused, and frustrated when the world gives you signals that are, inevitably, mixed.

People respect those with a strong sense of confidence, and they are unforgiving to those who lack it.

I never learned much about myself when things were easy. It’s only when I started putting myself out there, taking risks and struggling with mistakes, that I started to learn my own nature. We all have an idea of ourselves in our heads. We don’t realize that idea is wrong until we test that idea against reality, and see it shatter to pieces. Then, we create a new idea and try again, hopefully getting a little bit closer to the truth.

Confidence is the thing that lets you pursue your curiosities instead of just things that are “useful”.

Confidence is the thing that helps you prioritize your friends and family above everything else.

Confidence is the thing that makes you say “fuck it, I’m going on a roadtrip”.

So, I’m glad I got my licks in early.
