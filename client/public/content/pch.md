# God's road

This is, hands down, the best time of the year to drive down the Pacific Coast Highway from San Francisco to the Central Coast. It's gorgeous year round, the same beautiful winding highways and coastline greet you in January with just as much joy as they do in July. But, between late February and April there's the added bonus of a well watered landscape. On your right you have a coastline with curves wide enough to make a preacher feel like he cheated on his wife, and on your left are the kinds of fields I'd paint if someone asked me what I think heaven looks like.

I made my way down this highway twice this year on the way to Big Sur for some camping. Camping is the excuse, the real treat is the drive down there. Winding highways all the way down to Los Angeles and a generous view of the pacific along with all its friends: seals, humpback whales, dolphins, tourists. If I were given the power to save our poor friend Sysiphus, I'd take him from his ceaseless pushing and place him on a ceaseless drive down the Pacific Coast Highway.

The best part about having a good destination is that it makes the drive even better. It's the anticipation for something at the end of the road, sometimes more than the thing itself, that makes me happy.

I have a select few cherished drives down this highway stored in my mind like gemstones. Moments of unmatched happiness, spots of white in an otherwise static picture of my past. I noticed that all of these moments involved other people in my life. Either they were along for the ride, or they were the destination.

Solo trips, for me, are about recuperation, looking back on what's happened to me and, at times, finding an old memory that's turned into a new gemstone. Solo trips are about reflecting on old memories, whereas trips with other people are about creating new memories. These new memories don't look like much, especially when they're buried under a wet, slimy mess of neurons so badly mistreated. But, over time the heat and pressure of daily living may, eventually, turn that memory into a Diamond.

This process of creation and crystallization requires that there is a journey, that there's movement. Camping, in retrospect, is a wonderful lever I can pull when I find myself stuck in the same place for too long. You don't need much of an excuse to go, just say that you want to see some trees and shit. People don't usually argue with that.

I prefer to camp with a small group of friends. Nothing better than going with your buddies to goof off in the woods like a couple of kids. It's a much more intimate experience than Car Camping, and much more stimulating than Solo-Camping (see appendix for more discussion). These are the kinds of moments that turn good friends into lifelong friends and where memories are made.

Part of what makes this so effective at solidifying friendships is that nature breaks down our guards, it forces us to be vulnerable and act like ourselves because it saps us of the energy to fake it. There's nothing like having to shit in a hole to humble a man.

Some of my most cherished memories happened while I was camping. It's a case study in all the good virtues: humility, honesty, dealing with discomfort, problem solving, exciting shared experiences, and beauty. It's the feeling of being with a few friends, deciding out of nowhere that you're going to go somewhere beautiful and wild, planning, preparing, and going with half of a plan and enough enthusiasm to deal with any of the inevitable nonsense that will be thrown your way.

The important part though, is that it's an excuse to get out and go enjoy the beautiful things in life while you can, because apparently we need excuses to do that sort of thing.

So, go. Go exploit your friends. Trick them into thinking you got everything figured out when you really don't. Tell them The Beatles will be there. Tell them God will be there. Do whatever it takes to get them in the car and on the road. And if they freak out when they realize you lied through your teeth,

just tell them there's diamonds where you're going.

Along the beaten path. Then, a choice.
Go, or stay?

Go.
Down, down, to something that cannot be seen,

Nestled deep, once the choice is made just follow the pull
Downwards.
The air is dense. Senses saturate.
Did my face catch the breeze,
or a flame?
Go carefully, slowly, or risk losing oneself along the way.

A breakthrough.
The air is light, and light beams.
God's canopy, mirrored.
Walk forward.
Problems, past, desires, worries, wordviews, stripped.
Wade into a cold that reminds you what it is to be warm.
Head under, shock.

Head up, Look!

## Appendix

For those who are interested, I have provided a rigorous formula for camping that will make the planning process much simpler.

There are many different ways to camp, and for the interest of simplicity I have defined camping as the satisfaction of two variable categories:

**Category 1**: Big Group (BG) Camping, Small Group (SG) Camping, Solo (S) Camping
**Category 2**: Backpacking (BP), Car Camping (CC)


For Small Group (3-4 people) and Solo Camping, you can choose to either Backpack or Car Camp. However, if you're Big Group Camping, backpacking is no longer a valid category. More formally:

### Camping Criteria:
```
¬(BG ^ BP) ^ ¬(BP ^ CC) ^ ((BG xor SG) xor (!BG ^ S))
```
(Disclaimer: this is here because I think it's funny. If you don't have a background in formal logic, don't bother)

I already discussed Small Group camping above, so I won't bother with it again here. The other possibilities are discussed below.

#### BG= true ^ CC = true
If you're a Big Group, your only option while still satisfying the Camping Criteria is to Car Camp. If you're a Big Group going Car Camping, you're basically throwing a party in the woods. Get a bunch of rowdy young folks and let them pretend for a few nights they've gone back a couple thousand years in civilization, and this is the only rational result. People degenerate to the lowest common denominator when they gather, and in big groups that can get pretty low. There's nothing like waking up to the sun's rays beaming through the trees, the birds chirping, a light layer of dew, a bitch of a hangover and a campsite that looks like a cross between a squatter village and the wake of a Coors Light truck that jackknifed off the side of the highway.

It's funny to look at ourselves in this way. When we take away all of "our" hard-earned comforts, what are we? What's left? To me, it makes all this virtue signaling and god complex that we have in the city seem silly. In this environment we seem just slightly more evolved than apes, and not very resilient ones at that, considering all the creature comforts we have to take with us like sleeping bags, tents, fire starters, state-of-the-art charcoal water filters with flavor enhancements, trail mix, and backpacks with open-cell foam for increased ventilation and Ergonomic Comfort Lock hip fins.

There's nothing wrong with these things, it's just an interesting perspective. Maybe by going down a few evolutionary pegs for a weekend we'll think differently about our "civilized" lifestyles.

#### S=T ^ CC=T v BP=T
If you're solo camping, you can either Backpack or Car Camp. In my opinion, car camping solo should be done only when absolutely necessary, like if you're on a road trip by yourself and just need a place to sleep. Otherwise, you're just going to be surrounded by a bunch of other noisy folks  having a good time with their friends and family, no fun.

Needless to say it can get a bit lonely, and if you're like me too much time alone with your own thoughts can be exhausting. Not bad, just exhausting.

But, as we've said, experiences like this can be important. We need these moments of reflection like a machine needs regular maintenance. The difference though, is that a machine needs maintenance to keep it from falling apart, but we need maintenance in order to grow.
