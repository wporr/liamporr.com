# How I would describe TCOT with a gun to my head

It will happen to at least one of us. One day, the Secret Police start banging at your door, break in, hold you down with a gun and give you 10 seconds to tell them what the fuck TCOT is before you start to look like that guy from Pulp Fiction.

So, for you, whoever you are, I am going to save your life. I'm going to explain TCOT in a way that will at least buy you a few minutes to think of an escape while they struggle to [rotate shapes](https://roonscape.substack.com/p/a-song-of-shapes-and-words?s=r).

Trying to explain TCOT  is something we are all spectacularly bad at. One of the few things we do have in common is an understanding of how difficult it is to describe this group we're all a part of.

If you got one of these people, sat them down, and asked them with a straight face what "TCOT" or "Ingroup '' is, they may say something like "we're a group of people on twitter". The Secret Police won't buy that, John Travolta won't buy that. We need something better, dammit.

Most of the time, people are expecting that we have some kind of common interest, like a niche activity or ideology. The confusion arises when we fail to provide that, because we aren't a group of people discussing our passion and tips for underwater basket weaving, for example. The internet is famous for providing communities for all sorts of niche interests, and people have come to expect this.

No, we're all here for some other reason. Whereas most social media merely supports (or destroys) existing friendships, this group is able to create friendships. It's hard to be disingenuous here too. Most people are anonymous. Friends are bonded via text-based communication, with all the traditional barriers of appearance, money, race, etc stripped away.

This group formed naturally, like there was some physical property that caused us to settle in this place via the laws of physics. The name itself, This Corner of Twitter (TCOT), implies a group that coalesced not from some artificial attraction, but around some unique natural formation in cyberspace, like water settling into cracks in the ground. Once you find yourself nearby, you feel the pull, and get sucked in.

In TCOT, people like to post what's on their mind, things they're curious about. In comparison to other areas of twitter that I will not mention, this content is genuine. People rarely have an agenda, and yet they engage prolifically. This is probably the most engaged group of people on social media. The sense of community is so strong. Followers are true believers.

These people are open minded enough to be vulnerable about their lives in public with strangers. Thus, we have strangers who become not-strangers. This openness betrays a certain attitude towards life, one that is rare and should be cherished.

And yet, none of this is quite able to capture the feel of TCOT. It has a distinct flavor, like fine cheese.

At times, it feels like slipping into a reverie, a dreamy dance of wordplay and wit. A vomit of shitposts. Manic, screaming bouts of intellectual spew. It's motley, and melody. The ones who embody it most are the ones least able to explain it because it is not a way they have learned but a way of life.

I met many of these people over the past weekend at Vibecamp, a 3 day (wholesome) bender with TCOT'ers. Anyone who has been scrolling TCOT twitter over the last few days can see how much this weekend meant to the attendees. We're starved of community, starved of love. If this group stands for nothing else, it shows that modern life is failing to satisfy something, a certain need that lies deep inside us, a large mass that has been dormant, sleeping. This weekend gave that mass a pulse, an explosion of pent up energy like two halves of the earth's crust slipping from each other's grasp.

There were police there who were never needed, extinguishers that never met a fire. Find any other group of 400 adults with abundant alcohol and I dare you to imagine the level of conscientiousness and self-regulation that I observed here.

This new form of community has given me hope. Hope for our generation of brains withered by the ceaseless firehose of stimulation. Pessimism is the king of worldviews right now, but maybe we aren't completely fucked.

I was seeking people with strong spirits, with whom I could imbibe in some of the same, and that is what I found.
