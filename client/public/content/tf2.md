### Day 2
I woke up after a night of tossing and turning in my sleeping bag and went on a run. If you’re looking for a quick way to get some blisters, run in your hiking shoes. Works like a charm.

The San Louis Obisbo area during the springtime is unreal. The landscape makes you feel like you’re in a foreign country with its weird hills and unobstructed views

I was traveling north from Morro Bay on the way to Cambria. I stopped in a place called Cayucos for gas and an oil change. I asked the Russian gas-station attendant where I could get one and he told me to go to Nelson’s Garage. I never got that oil change, but they did have more Toyota Land Cruiser’s than I’ve ever seen in one spot. I’m not sure what it is about these central coast Cayucosians, but they don’t mess around when it comes to off-road vehicles, and now I really want one.

Next, to Cambria. Nestled in a valley right off the coast, this cute little town has just about every antique you could ever think of. Shops, 11am drinks, grandparents, you name it they got it. I stopped here and got gifts for my parents from one of the many antique stores.

I doubled back south to SLO, shivered on Pismo Beach, walked through the Santa Barbara farmer’s market, and stopped at Westlake village outside of LA where I was staying with a friend.

I bought some flowers at the farmers market so I wouldn’t come to my friend’s place empty-handed. I’m told its polite to bring a small gift when people let you stay in their home. But, then I started second guessing myself. Is it weird to bring flowers to your guy-friend’s house? I consider myself socially intelligent most of the time. However, even the best of us have our occasional lapses, and I was now less-than-confident in what reaction I may get.

I decided to let satire do the work for me. I made an elaborate show by pretending I was there to take my friend to prom, which worked like a charm. We spent the rest of the evening racing around the Santa Monica Hills and I saw a lookout spot called “God’s seat”.

The day went well, but there were some parts that were distracting. Seeing videos of your friends living it up during spring break while sitting at a gas station in middle-of-nowhere central coast can definitely screw with your head.

FOMO is an interesting thing. Notice it is “Fear Of Missing Out”. You are not actually missing out, but fearing that you may be. This is a classic issue of social misperception. You’re having a good time until you think your friends might be having a better time somewhere else.

More than once I asked myself, “It’s your last spring break, why aren’t you on the beach with a drink somewhere warm and sunny?”. When faced with this delimma and my terrible tendency to second guess decisions, I have to ask myself “is this the best choice for me?”.

In this instance, the answer was most definitely yes. I needed this trip now more than ever, and looking back, I have no regrets.

This trip was necessary for some serious personal growth. I had a fear that any time I would go on a solo trip I would become lonely. It is clear, already on day 2, that this is a bunch of nonsense. It’s frustrating to realize that this same fear has prevented me from having so many other cool experiences. I'm beginning to realize that when I don’t let these fears get in the way, I end up having a lot more fun.

### Day 3

I wanted to have an easy day. The last two were full to the brim, nonstop movement from place to place. This time, I had an nice morning, worked out, and drove to LA. There, I visited a friend in Culver City, had some painfully spicy food at this place called Al’s Hot Chicken, and traveled down to Orange county.

There, I took a sunset walk on the beach, drank with some friends in Newport, and called it a night.

This day closely resembled the lifestyle I’ve been living for the last few months, a life of leisure: eating, drinking, visiting friends, etc. In my mind, this is supposed to be the life.

Without admiting it to myself, I always secretly wanted a lucky break. I wanted a “lifestyle business”, one where I could make money in my sleep and spend my free time doing whatever I wanted. This is the promise of new-age entrepreneurship.

The lifestyle I imagined living if I ever achieved that goal was very similar to the lifestyle I was living right now. In fact, the lifestyle I’m living right now may even be better than what I would have if I were semi-rich. There are things you can get away with as a college student that you can’t as an adult.

Why, then, do I feel like there is something missing?

I realized that it’s the lack of responsibilities, the abundance of leasure, that is making me feel unfulfilled. Passage from _Greenlights_:

> Create structure so you can have freedom. Create your weather so you can blow in the wind. Map your direction so you can swerve in the lanes. Clean up so you can get dirty. Choreograph, then dance. Learn to read and write before you start making up words.

> Creativity needs borders. Individuality needs resistance. The earth needs gravity. Without them there is no form. No art. Only chaos.

As humans we need a certain amount of stress in our lives to feel fulfilled. Too little, and we feel empty. Too much, and we are overworked. What we need is that middleground. Without it, I have no chance to prove myself, to come up with creative solutions to problems. Nothing sparks creativity like serious, anxiety-inducing obligations. It has made me realize that a life of leasure will never make me happy.

It helps me optimize for fun rather than utility, to live a full and exciting life instead of trying to gain capital. Seek things out, extract what you want out of life. Accept that there’s no easy route, stop looking for one.
