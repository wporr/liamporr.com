# CALIFORNIA CULT HUNTING

![image](sleepy.jpeg)

The stretch of land from Livermore up until Sonora county is a wasteland. There's two kinds of small towns: cute small towns with farmer's markets and local artists, and dumpy small towns. These are real American towns where you feel the depression surround you like a fog while you're passing through it. I mean depression in a very physical sense. There's a slowness of movement, like everything there is starved and decaying. Things don't move up but move out like a bell curve that's flattening, taking up space for the sake of it. To alleviate the minutiae of life in these places they have every fast food chain in America. Fast food chains might be the most American product we have to offer the world–various rehashings of the same food, maybe add some different labels on it, flash different colors to keep ourselves entertained. We'd probably be better off without these places, but if you lived in one of these places you'd know just about the most exciting thing that ever happens is a new fast food place opening up. You can pull weeks worth of small talk from a single new Cains location. It may not be wise to remove this source of attention, else they may find other things to talk about.


I think this feeling that seeps up from the cracked concrete sidewalks of these towns is felt harder by the young people. Adults by-and-large come to these places for very practical reasons. When their depressive smell-receptors are dulled by the overwhelming need to provide for a family, then these things I'm talking about dont matter, or they matter less. This oppressive stench is felt most strongly by the youth, who's life up until now has been a series of outward observations. What you often get is an underdeveloped ability to distinguish between something wrong with themselves versus something wrong with their environment. The young can't help but smell it. It's nauseating and makes you dizzy. It permeates your existence and it's impossible to ignore. Is it you or everything around you?


Some people look to escape, and do. Some others, most of them, stay. For reasons abound, they stay. Some stay for good reasons, some stay for bad reasons. Some stay for good reasons but think it's a bad reason, and vice-versa. They all learn to live with the stench, to forget. Marriage, and especially children, are a good way to forget. I don't blame anyone for marrying young. Do what you need. I am, after all, just a visitor here. I'm just passing by. I'm not even from here, but I know what these places are like. They're the same all over– the forgotten parts of America. The half that nobody talks about because they keep to themselves.


I've been through this way in the past. I remember the scent, and as I drove through I tried to forget too, to remember why I'm out here. A friend of mine has been living in the woods for a few months. He's living with other people, people who are also looking to forget. I've heard stories about this place before and I just had to see it myself. There's a certain greed I have to see all the different ways people choose to live. I often fear that I don't even possess the tools to imagine a different way of living, the inability to distinguish. We're all dealing with that very same problem, and many people come up with the same answer, but some clever people come up with clever answers. It can be comforting to glimpse over someone else's shoulder, but the issue with coming up with answers to hard problems is that there's never much of an answer.


Sonora county is when things start to get beautiful. Rolling hills of brown, dead grass. They upset the outsider at first glance but grow on you like the smell of fresh leather and good dirt. The gateway to the Sierras.


I was listening to the Wetbrain podcast, which in many ways feels like Gen-Z culture at the fringes. They have these brains that eat up conversations and shoot out witty, ironic humor like a machine gun. Deep, difficult-to-differentiate-from-the-truth kind of irony. They save all sincerity for cynical surrender–we may be terrified of our world but at least we'll go down laughing.


I turned it off. My brain is tired. I want to listen to music without words because music with words talks about all the same problems anyway. With music without words I have a blank slate. I have the freedom to interpret things a bit more optimistically, to graft the music onto my surroundings. Flavien Berger, Lxury, Tycho, KAASI, Tourist. I'm in the presence of the trees and the hills and the fresh air that consume my periphery.


I was entering a place where I did not belong. Not because of any inherent differences between them and I, but because of the simple fact that they're already there and I'm coming into it, just for a night. They, in fact, were really not that different from me. Shared mutual experiences, similar backgrounds. Someone recognized my necklace, the same person made theirs too.


You can always tell when you're entering someone's home, even when that home is outside in the wilderness. There's the overwhelming feeling of someone living there, signs of life and human traces scattered around. You can walk into these places and understand what it feels like to live there. To foreign eyes the feeling is crisp. The day-to-day dulls it, but it's still a true experience.


People helped me find my friend and returned to their other duties. There's no sense in sticking around. I asked a question and they gave me an answer, there's no need for further inquiry. My friend, too, needed to attend to some chores soon after I arrived. He said to look around, make friends, and watch out for a group headed to the other camp for the evening shows, he'll meet me there. He didn't say who or where, just that they would exist.


New places are uncomfortable. My instinct is to force myself upon the place, learn about it, and bring a feeling of control. Remove the fear of the unknown and replace it with the comfort of knowing. Sometimes though, it's easier not to force these things. I sat on a couch that lived under the redwoods and people-watched. They attended to domestic duties, living their normal life out there. Engage them in conversation, ask questions. They're often glad to have some reprieve and talk with someone new. Like the answering of a prophecy, or catching a big fish in a black lake of unknown, the topic of going to the next camp came up, and seeing my signal I told what I was told to tell.


Pile into a car, 3 in the back, 4 in the middle, 3 in the front. 3-4-3 go deeper into the woods, where the rituals are performed. Skits, for the kids. See, families like to bring their kids out here, to watch the cultists dance and perform miracles dreamt up while smashed on a canoe at 6 in the morning. The families, too, like to perform their own miracles, those of drinking and forgetting and remembering songs from easier times. Maybe one day I could bring my kids here too. These people aren't very different from me, just different permutations of myself had the universe chosen to weigh the dice differently. There's me as a banker, that's me with long hair and beads, there's me in a dress if I'd pulled two X's instead of one from that wrinkly genetic hat. All the ceremonies were performed. Fire dancing, singing sacred songs, summoning ghosts to bring a laugh, jumping and screaming from stagetops, raw eggs eaten, milk spilt, hot sauce drank, kids splashed and laughed.


Just like that it was done. The euphoric effects of the ceremony lingered with us as we began our preparations for the evening party.


I've been to these woods once before, with a friend and a friend who's now less of a friend but still my friend. A party of 3.


3-4-3 drove to the bar, a backcountry outfit to serve thirsty campers. I stuck my head out the window to feel the night air. They chanted my name for reasons I didn't understand


> LE-UM LE-UM LE-UM


I don't think they understood much either. This wasn't a group driven by reason, but by groupthink. They were belongers in a group and I was a non-belonger, but they've spent so much time in belonger-land that they only know how to treat other people as belongers even if they arent. I was grateful for it.


The stars are something you always forget you missed. Out there deep in the Sierras the stars shine like diamonds stuck in the rock of the sky. We moved every which way, curving left, right, rolling sideways and yet those stars stayed locked in their solid brilliance.


Somewhere around the bend sits three men around a fire eating cheesy potatoes and Jack Daniels.


That wooded bar was a dim reverie of backcountry phantoms and ghouls. Even Sisyphus parked his '85 Lincoln Towncar outside.


Inside was a black soup of bodies and ectoplasm held together by a bowl of wood veneer.  Tonight, it was spy themed. Not for any particular reason, someone just yelled that one louder than the others: aspen ski trip, formal dress, 80's prom massacre. There was an inside joke happening at the time, for some reason lots of guys had "Free OSK" on their shirts. Not sure who OSK is or why their freedom was taken from them, but I had their battle cry written on the back of my neck. Groupthink. Many others had it on shirts, arms, foreheads, etc. On top of that most everyone had the same haircuts. Mullets, boys and girls all, nearly, had mullets.

A motley of skinwalkers and doppelgangers. People come here not to find themselves but to forget themselves. They come to join and mold into a living soup.  Identities wiped blank. The erasure eased with alcohol, to break down the defenses. Like a liquid they form to the vessel that encloses them, and under my gaze they formed to my own life and years past. Friends, ex girlfriends, familiar faces I both long for and wish to forget. A crude mold of my memories. I could join that mass, enclose myself in the memories I clung to and become part of it. An existence that is no longer defined by distinguishing between self and other. Why bother anymore, why not just submit. It was right there in front of me, all I had to do was dive in. One step. Take that one step over the precipice. Just as I began to peek, to glimpse, I heard two men outside arguing, loudly. Something about kids, and race, and school. They were having a debate about politics, ideas. What followed was a loud thud, bone on bone muffled by meat.


> "Ouch, FUCK!"


I looked outside to try and see what was going on, but all I saw was two guys talking away, together. One of them was rubbing their cheek, the other had an arm around his shoulder. Where was the third? I turned back around, but all I saw was a bunch of drunk college students. I found my friend and told him it was time to go home.


The designated drivers scooped us up and we tumbled into the soft velvet of night. I left my friends and went twisting, whirling towards my spot before I plopped on the soft pine needles. I laid there, locked between the ground and that solid shining wall of granite and diamonds. Sometime during that period my consciousness left me and returned with the sunrise.
