<span class="caption">How routines make me feel.</span>

Routine.
Wake up to that awful iPhone alarm sound. It may be the worst sound ever created by the likes of men, but nothing gets my ass out of bed faster.

Groggy, stayed up too late again. Not gonna let that happen tonight, even though that's exactly what I told myself the day before.

Brush my teeth, and the problems creep back into my head. Now today feels just like yesterday.

Is San Francisco foggy or sunny today?
Sunny, beautiful. The most beautiful state on earth. Wish I could spend a bit more of my day out there.

Make some coffee, eat some breakfast, then off to work, in my bedroom.

#### Routines
Routines are one of those necessary evils in one's life. We need them to keep ourselves accountable, yet they kill the soul, or at least my soul. As I go around making breakfast and drinking coffee I see nothing, my mind is on autopilot. I see the problems in my life, I'm not oblivious to them, but I also can't see myself living any differently. The routine guarantees its own persistence. I tell myself that routines are a way of improving my life, a form of asceticism that will help get me to the lifestyle I want to live.

But really, routines don't help me change. Routines are, well… routines. They're cyclical, round and round in this little playground I built to keep myself in line.

If I stay in a routine for too long I start to go a little crazy. You can feel it, it's like being stuck in a funk. There are some things I can try to help get myself out of it, like going camping or listening to some old music. Sometimes though, the universe will pull you out instead.

Today, I found a security guard asleep on the couch.

I approach my days like I'm an independent agent, like I'm detached from the world and inflicting my will upon it. This is just how I was raised to think, the worldview I was taught. Sometimes implicitly, sometimes explicitly:

> [O]n the one hand I have a clear and distinct idea of myself, in so far as I am simply a thinking, non-extended thing [that is, a mind], and on the other hand I have a distinct idea of body, in so far as this is simply an extended, non-thinking thing. And accordingly, it is certain that I am really distinct from my body, and can exist without it (Descartes, Sixth Meditation)

It feels like the objects I interact with on a day-to-day basis have no connection to me. I become so wrapped up in my own head that I really start to lose touch with the people and things around me. I start to not see people as people anymore. They seem more like shell-people, husks of skin and hair. Sometimes it's only with strangers, but sometimes it's with friends too. As far as I'm concerned they have no lives outside of my encounters with them, like machines built for an oddly specific task.

*This security guard is dead asleep with a bag of greasy late night food.*

*I poke him a couple times.*

*Definitely human, probably. I wonder what brought him to this strange place.*

I recently listened to David Foster Wallace's 2005 commencement speech to Kenyon college "This is Water". Here, DFW refers to the independent agent mindset as one's "default setting". We live this way without choice, and often without awareness. We live with this self centered worldview because every experience we've ever had has us at the center of it.

> "We rarely think about this sort of natural, basic self-centredness because it’s so socially repulsive".

When we live our lives feeling like this detached agent, it's easy to lose one's connection with reality. Instead of being in touch with the things around me, I live my everyday life processing the incessant stream of internal thoughts. My internal monologue: judging, qualifying, never satisfied. I'm hypnotized, stuck. It can take days to get out of the rut. Days without breaking that stream of thoughts, days without encountering a real human.

This is a commencement speech. In a way, it's the speech I and tens of thousands of other covid graduates never got. Bad commencement speeches are for speakers who can't get enough of themselves. Good commencement speeches are for the students, to remind them why they paid so much money for their education and how they can use it.

DFW mentions that the real benefit of a liberal arts education is not that it teaches you how to think, but that it teaches us to pay attention to what we think about. In fact, the real danger of a liberal arts education is failing to utilize this skill. College gives you the ability to justify just about any opinion you may have with the right argumentative skills. Think about how dangerous it would be if every American suddenly developed sound reasoning and evidence for every opinion they have? It is our responsibility as citizens to reconsider the kinds of thoughts and opinions we give our attention to. This not only prevents QAnon from running wild but also helps save us from ourselves.

DFW mentions an old cliché — the mind is an excellent servant, but a terrible master. In my default state I'm allowing my mind to be my master. It takes the most vulnerable parts of my personality and uses them against me: paranoia, insecurity, need for validation. In my case, it's one of those deceptive traits that led to a lot of externally good things in my life but sucked away all the happiness those things would have provided. I can't live in my default state all the time, it's maddening. I forget about all the beautiful things in the world and instead I'm left with this thing that won't leave me alone.

I had never thought that I should be weary of my own thoughts. We live in a culture that places so much value on intelligence. I had not realized, as many of you who've gone through therapy already know, that the mind can be self destructive and adversarial.

For some reason, our default states tend to place us at the center of the universe, and it makes us assume the worst in others. When we're driving and someone cuts us off, or at the DMV and someone cuts in line, it's easy to assume they're bad people. When these things happen we don't see people, we see barriers, adversaries. It's easy to assume because it's always our first instinct and because it takes deliberate effort to think otherwise. It's hard to think of them as people with their own problems like us. But if we don't, and we live our whole lives this way, the world feels very small.

In Jungian psychology, there's this notion of the shadow. This is a part of ourselves that exists unconsciously (roughly analogous to the Freudian unconscious). It includes parts of ourselves that we reject or deny. Jung wrote

> "Everyone carries a shadow, and the less it is embodied in the individual's conscious life, the blacker and denser it is."

Jung believes that we tend to project our shadow. What we see as flaws inherent in other people are things we deny most within ourselves. Part of the process of personal growth is to join with our shadow, learning to accept the parts of ourselves we loathe so much we won't even admit they exist.

When I was younger, I started to become paranoid about adult life. When I think back about what I wanted to be when I grew up, a few things come to mind: engineer, tinkerer, businessman, inventor. I liked playing around with science and building things, but this does not lead to the level of paranoia I had around making good grades. I was paranoid because I was afraid of becoming the people I saw around me. Like everyone else, as I grew up I saw many people who weren't happy with their jobs. I never wanted to be stuck in a shitty life like that.

Gotta make sure I get a good job! Get a good job and I'll be happy.

The reality though, was very different. Many of you who are older and have had shitty jobs and have friends who have shitty jobs know that you don't need a good job to be happy. Many of you have families and friends who love you dearly, and can provide you with much more happiness than any job ever could, so who cares if you're a janitor, or an oilfield worker, or a teacher in one of the worst school districts in the state [1].

It's my own fear of failure that causes a lot of the dissatisfaction I see in the world around me. It's my fear that I wont do enough, that I'll waste my years in life doing the wrong thing. This is where my mind becomes my master, constantly pointing out the ways I could be doing more, and pointing towards other people as an example of what not to do.

If I spent a bit more effort talking to these "failures" I might realize that I'm wrong, that some of these people may even be deeply satisfied with their lives. I could spend a bit more mental effort imagining the lives people have outside of my interactions with them. If I spent a bit less time in my own head and a bit more time observing, this would be obvious. I have to remind myself of the obvious, the things that are so present that I've become blind to them.

I could look at this security guard and be frustrated that he's ruining my morning ambiance (cue monocle man meme) with his greasy food and his snoring. Or, I can stop being a pretentious ass, and take a second to think. I've talked to that guy before, he works the graveyard shift. I don't know exactly why he's here right now, but that's not my business. I'm sure he has his reasons. The guy has his own life and his own problems, and the last thing he needs is someone giving him unwarranted bullshit.

It is not enough to be aware of our default state. We must fight our daily battle to keep ourselves out of it. It's not possible to do it all the time, but we must make a consistent effort to do so. Eventually, our mental masters will slowly lose their grasp on us.

It's not easy. Some of the most spirited people in the world still succumb to their internal masters. David Foster Wallace, the man responsible for this fantastic speech and for this entire essay, was lost to his master.

[1]: Seriously, according to [Texas School Guide](https://texasschoolguide.org/content/uploads/2019/11/2019-Texas-UPDATED-High-School-Rankings_Statewide.pdf) my town's public high school was ranked 1360 out of 1423 schools in the state. I was fortunate enough to afford the town's private school, otherwise I probably wouldn't be here.
